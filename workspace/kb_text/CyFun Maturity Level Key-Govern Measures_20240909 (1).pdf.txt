Disclaimer

To guide organisations in the CyFun(r) self-assessment (Basic, Important and Essential) and to support the

CyFun(r) Conformity Assessment Scheme, CCB has created assessments of the different maturity levels for key

measures and measures related to entity management.

The attached assessments are intended as guidance to help assessors distinguish between the different maturity

levels. An entity's maturity level assessment may differ from this because of:

*  Context, perspective or scope

*  Organisation-specific implementations

As described in the CyFun(r) Conformity Assessment Scheme, it remains up to the assessor to evaluate the self-

assessment along with supporting objective evidence.

More information on the CyFun(r) Conformity Assessment Scheme can be found on www.cyfun.eu

Clarifications

Review:

In the implementation guidance the terminology "review" is used in the evidence to be considered. "Review" is

defined as the internal assessment activity undertaken by the organisation to determine the suitability,

adequacy and effectiveness of the subject under assessment to assign a maturity level. (Based on the

definition of "review" in ISO/IEC 27000)

management.

Controlled (versioned, approved) documentation (strategy, objectives, policies, and procedures) exists to ensure that the
organization identifies, assesses, and mitigates cybersecurity supply chain risks. This documentation is reviewed regularly,
approved, updated when changes occur. Supply chain risk management plan exists for all the organisation's critical
mission and business functions.

There is no standard process ensuring that the organization documents, reviews, approves, updates when changes occur,

of the risks associated with the distributed and interconnected nature of ICT/OT product and service supply chains.

Supply chain risk management plans are intuitively created and implemented without a formal framework.

A formal cyber supply chain risk management process exist and is implemented ensuring that the organization identifies,
assesses, and mitigates cybersecurity supply chain risks, taking into account the documented and approved exceptions
(being missing supply chain risk management plans for critical mission and business functions). Evidence is available for
most cybersecurity supply chain risks. Assessments show, for less than 10% of the sample used during an assessment,
that the identified risk response actions for a specific supply chain cyber security risk cannot be shown to adequately
mitigate the cyber security risk.

including processing, analysing and remedying vulnerabilities from internal and external sources, exists.

A policy or process to manage vulnerabilities, including processing, analysing and remedying vulnerabilities from internal
and external sources, is formally documented (version controlled and approved) but not reviewed regularly (e.g. not
reviewed in the previous 2 years).

A policy or process to manage vulnerabilities is formally documented (version controlled and approved) and reviewed
regularly. Exceptions (e.g. for reason of acceptable use or acceptable risk) are documented and approved and limited to a
target of 5% of the assets in scope or as defined through a risk assessment.

A policy or process to manage and report vulnerabilities is formally documented (version controlled and approved) and
reviewed regularly. Exceptions (e.g. for reason of acceptable use or acceptable risk) are documented and approved and
limited to a target of 3% of the assets in scope or as defined through a risk assessment.

A policy or process to manage and report vulnerabilities is formally documented (version controlled and approved) and

No vulnerability management policy, including processing, analysing and remedying vulnerabilities from internal and
external sources, nor process is in place.

Vulnerability management is done ad hoc, without clear responsibilities and authorities.

The vulnerability management process is rolled out as documented. Evidence on process implementation is available for
most activities. Reviews (e.g. audits) of the vulnerability management process reveal less than 10% cases where the
process is not followed (e.g. vulnerabilities identified but not remediated as prescribes in the vulnerability management
process, information from internal and/or external sources that are neglected).

The vulnerability management process is rolled out as documented. Evidence on process implementation is available for all

Performance of vulnerability management is reported as described in the vulnerability management process.

There is no communication of recovery activities to predefined stakeholders, executive and management teams.

Communication of recovery activities to predefined stakeholders, executive and management teams is done on an ad hoc

Communication of recovery activities to predefined stakeholders, executive and management teams is done as specified in
the relevant process documentation, including the documented exceptions. Evidence on process implementation is

What does TLP Green mean?

TRAFFIC LIGHT PROTOCOL (TLP)

Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful to increase

awareness within their wider community.

Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner

organizations within their community, but not via publicly accessible

channels (e.g. websites, LinkedIn...). TLP:GREEN information may not be

shared outside of the community. Note: when "community" is not defined,

assume the cybersecurity/defense community.
