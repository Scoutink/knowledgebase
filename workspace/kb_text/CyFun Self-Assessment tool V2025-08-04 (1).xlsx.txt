"This workbook is the self-assessment tool for the CyberFundamentals Framework. The CyberFundamentals Framework is developed by the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB), which operates under the authority of the Prime Minister of Belgium. The framework includes a set of concrete measures to protect data, significantly reduce the risk of the most common cyber-attacks, and increase the cyber resilience of organisations.
The framework is available for both voluntary and mandatory use.
In case of voluntary use, it is considered as National Certification Scheme for Cybersecurity Certification implementing the statutory mandate of the CCB (RD 10 Oct 2014, Art. 3 8deg).
For mandatory use of the certification scheme, the laws and regulations imposing mandatory use apply.
The Cyberfundamentals Conformity self-declaration is based on a self-assessment using this tool. The self-declaration can be verified by an independent third-party Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) and will then result in a label, a verified claim or a certificate in accordance with the Conformity Assessment Scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Change Log,,,

"Directions:
(1) Each "details" tab contains the controls of the respective cyberfundamentals framework level (BASIC-IMPORTANT- ESSENTIAL).
The way each control is assessed considers 2 angles: How the controle is documented (documentation maturity) and how that documentation is implemented (implementation maturity). The maturity of each of the controls is assessed using the explanation in the Maturity Levels tab.
(2) Based on the assessment and according to the maturity level, a value from 1 to 5 is entered per control in the ""details"" tab of each assurance level. This level is determined for both documentation maturity and implementation maturity.
(3) The ""summary"" tab for the respective cyberfundamentals levels shows the maturity score that determines whether or not one is compliant in accordance with the Conformity Assessment Scheme. The target scores indicated in the ""summary"" tab are as determined in the Conformity Assessment Scheme.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Applicable version of the CyberFundamentels framework,,,
