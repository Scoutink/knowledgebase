*                      Cybersecurity best practices

* Fully aligned with CyberFundamentals Assurance Levels

Basic, Important and Essential

Small - Cybersecurity best practices

1. Use Multi-Factor Authentication whenever possible.

* Always use Multi-Factor Authentication on remote access

2.

3.

4.

5.

Implement security updates/patches for all your software
as soon as they are available.

Implement an anti-virus solution on all types of devices and
keep it up-to-date to ensure its continuous effectiveness.

Protect your network by installing a firewall.

Protect data on the network accessed via Wi-Fi using
wireless encryption standards.

6.

Pay specific attention to remote access security.

Small - Cybersecurity best practices

7. Regularly perform automated backups of your information.

* Put a backup OFF-LINE (not connected to the network) weekly or every few weeks.

* After mayor changes, backup your systems so you can restore them more easily.

8.

Ensure that no one works with administrator privileges for daily tasks.

9. Restrict physical access:

* Protection of computers and mobile devices against theft or improper use.

* Restrict access to premises, backups, servers, and network components to authorized

individuals only.

10. Know-how and who to contact in case of a cyber incident.

CyberFundamentals Assurance Levels

BASIC

*Standard security measures for all enterprises.
*Technology and processes generally available.
*Known cyber security risks.

IMPORTANT

*Targeted cyber-attacks.
*By actors with common skills and resources.

ESSENTIAL

*Targeted advanced cyber-attacks.
*By actors with extensive skills and resources.

Operational Risk Assessment

Assurance levels
based on cyber risk

Risk assessment is mandatory and included in Art 30 of the BE NIS2 legislation.

Risk assessment is the core of the CyberFundamentals Framework

BASIC - ID.GV-4.1: As part of the company's overall risk management, a comprehensive

strategy to manage information security and cybersecurity risks shall be developed
and updated when changes occur.

BASIC - ID.RA-5.1: The organization shall conduct risk assessments in which risk is

determined by threats, vulnerabilities and impact on business processes and assets.

No specific methodology to perform risk assessment is imposed.
