,"Mapping CyberFundamentals, CIS v8, IEC 62443-2-1:2010, IEC 62443-3-3:2013, NBN ISO/IEC 27001:2023 and NBN EN ISO/IEC 27002:2022"

,"Navigating the world of security can be complex. To aid organizations, CCB has crafted mapping tables comparing requirements and security controls between CIS v8, IEC 62443-2-1:2010, IEC 62443-3-3:2013, NBN ISO/IEC 27001:2023 and NBN EN ISO/IEC 27002:2022  and the CyberFundamentals framework (Basic, Important and Essential).

These mapping tables reflect if a security control from the CyberFundamentals framework satisfies the intent of a mapped requirement/control from CIS v8, IEC 62443-2-1:2010, IEC 62443-3-3:2013, NBN ISO/IEC 27001:2023 & NBN EN ISO/IEC 27002:2022, and conversely. The aim is to result in an equivalent information security posture.

However, CCB cautions that organizations should not assume full control equivalency based on the mapping tables.

This is due to several reasons:
*	The mappings are not always a perfect one-to-one match.
*	Different topics addressed in the two security control sets may have a different context, perspective, or scope.
*	Organization-specific implementations can also influence control equivalency."
