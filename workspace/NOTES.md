# Notes

- PDFs are the single source of truth; text extraction is for indexing only.
- Keep per-page text to allow precise references in answers.
- Use stable, minimal dependencies to simplify deployment.
- Avoid renaming original files; mirror them under site/files/ preserving paths.
- Ensure links avoid spaces issues by URL-encoding in templates.
