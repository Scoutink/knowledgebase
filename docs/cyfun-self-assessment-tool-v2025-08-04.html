			<pre>This workbook is the self-assessment tool for the CyberFundamentals Framework. The
CyberFundamentals Framework is developed by the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium (CCB),
which operates under the authority of the Prime Minister of Belgium. The framework includes a
set of concrete measures to protect data, significantly reduce the risk of the most common
cyber-attacks, and increase the cyber resilience of organisations.

The framework is available for both voluntary and mandatory use.

In case of voluntary use, it is considered as National Certification Scheme for Cybersecurity
Certification implementing the statutory mandate of the CCB (RD 10 Oct 2014, Art. 3 8°).

For mandatory use of the certification scheme, the laws and regulations imposing mandatory
use apply.

The Cyberfundamentals Conformity self-declaration is based on a self-assessment using this
tool. The self-declaration can be verified by an independent third-party Conformity Assessment
Body (CAB) and will then result in a label, a verified claim or a certificate in accordance with the
Conformity Assessment Scheme.

Directions:

(1) Each “details” section contains the controls of the respective cyberfundamentals framework
level (BASIC-IMPORTANT- ESSENTIAL).

The way each control is assessed considers 2 angles: How the controle is documented
(documentation maturity) and how that documentation is implemented (implementation
maturity). The maturity of each of the controls is assessed using the explanation in the Maturity
Levels tab.

(2) Based on the assessment and according to the maturity level, a value from 1 to 5 is entered
per control in the &#34;details&#34; tab of each assurance level. This level is determined for both
documentation maturity and implementation maturity.

(3) The &#34;summary&#34; tab for the respective cyberfundamentals levels shows the maturity score
that determines whether or not one is compliant in accordance with the Conformity Assessment
Scheme. The target scores indicated in the &#34;summary&#34; tab are as determined in the Conformity
Assessment Scheme.</pre>

			<pre>CyberFundamentals Framework — Maturity Levels
Overview
The CyberFundamentals Framework, developed by the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium
(CCB) under the authority of the Prime Minister of Belgium, defines a structured approach to
assessing and improving organizational cybersecurity resilience.
This framework supports both voluntary and mandatory adoption for organizations operating
under Belgian jurisdiction.

When used voluntarily, it serves as a National Certification Scheme for Cybersecurity
Certification, implementing the statutory mandate of the CCB (Royal Decree 10 October 2014,
Article 3, §8).
For mandatory application, compliance is required as specified in the applicable laws and
regulations.

The CyberFundamentals Conformity Self-Declaration is based on a self-assessment using
this tool.
Verification by an independent Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) may result in an official
label, verified claim, or certificate under the Conformity Assessment Scheme.

Directions for Using the Self-Assessment Tool

1.

1.

2.

Each Details section contains the controls for the respective CyberFundamentals
framework levels — BASIC, IMPORTANT, and ESSENTIAL.
Each control is assessed on two dimensions:

o Documentation Maturity — how well the control is formally defined and

approved.

o Implementation Maturity — how effectively the documented control is applied

in practice.

Based on the assessment, each control is assigned a maturity value (1 to 5) for both
documentation and implementation.
These values are entered in the “Details” tab of each assurance level.
The Summary tab displays overall maturity scores that determine compliance in
accordance with the Conformity Assessment Scheme.
Target scores per level (Basic, Important, Essential) are also defined within this tab.

sensitive business or personal data are securely deleted (i.e. electronically â€œwipedâ€)
before they are removed and then physically destroyed (or re-commissioned). This is also
known as â€œsanitizationâ€ and thus related to the requirement and guidance in PR.IP-6.

Consider installing a remote-wiping application on company laptops, tablets, cell phones,

Observed Pattern in the Radar Chart

· Target Maturity (green line): forms an outer circular band around level 2.5, indicating
that the BASIC level aims for a “Repeatable” state of control implementation across all
domains.

· Category Maturity (orange line): remains near the 1.0 level, indicating “Initial”

maturity, meaning processes exist in some form but are informal and inconsistently
applied.

· Documentation Maturity (gray line) and Implementation Maturity (blue line) nearly
overlap, both hovering tightly around 1.0, forming a small inner circle at the center of the
radar graph.

· The graph shows a notable depression in the Maintenance (PR.MA) axis, but all

categories generally remain at or below the Initial level (1.0–1.1).</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-38">
			<h3>Page 38</h3>
			<pre>Analytical Interpretation (Strictly Based on Chart Data)

The CyberFundamentals BASIC radar chart illustrates that the organization’s actual maturity
remains significantly below the targeted threshold of 2.5 across all functions.

· The target expectations (green line) represent the required “Repeatable” maturity state

for entities at BASIC assurance level.

· However, the measured performance (blue and gray lines) suggests that the

organization’s cybersecurity posture is still in the “Initial” stage, where procedures are
mostly undocumented, ad hoc, and dependent on individual effort rather than defined
processes.

The radar’s symmetry (almost circular shape at level 1.0) shows consistent underperformance
across all categories — indicating that the gap between documented controls and operational
implementation is uniform.

This means:

· Policies exist conceptually but lack formalized documentation and procedural

enforcement.

· No category exceeds maturity level 1.1, showing minimal variation among IDENTIFY,

PROTECT, DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER functions.

· Target maturity (2.5) is not met in any domain, suggesting foundational work is still

required to reach a repeatable, process-driven security baseline.

Interpretive Summary

The radar chart reflects a low overall cyber maturity profile for BASIC level assessment.
It conveys that while the organization may understand the required cybersecurity functions
conceptually, its actual execution and documentation remain at the Initial stage (level 1).

Visually, the chart shows:

· The Target (green) ring at level 2.5 forming an external perimeter.
· The Documentation (gray) and Implementation (blue) lines overlapping near the

center at level 1.0, representing early maturity.

This visual and numeric pattern indicates a uniform capability gap across all domains — a
typical profile for organizations at the start of their CyberFundamentals Framework compliance
journey.

Observed Distribution Pattern (Chart Interpretation)

· The Target Maturity Scores (green) consistently range between 3.0 and 3.5, reflecting

the expected “Defined” to “Managed” level under the ESSENTIAL tier of the
CyberFundamentals Framework.</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-214">
			<h3>Page 214</h3>
			<pre>· The Category Maturity Scores (orange) remain at approximately 1.0–1.1 across all

domains, corresponding to an “Initial” stage of capability maturity.

· Both Documentation (gray) and Implementation (blue) maturity lines closely overlap at

around 1.0, forming a nearly circular plot in the innermost band of the radar chart.

This alignment indicates minimal divergence between policy documentation and its execution
— both equally underdeveloped relative to targets.

Interpretive Analysis (based strictly on chart and data)

The radar visualization depicts an organization that has defined target expectations (3.0–3.5)
across all NIS2-aligned functional areas but exhibits uniformly low practical maturity (≈1.0)
in both documentation and implementation.
This consistent gap suggests that the foundational elements (policy documentation, control
execution, and process validation) are largely at an initial stage of development across all
functional domains.

In visual terms:

· The target layer (green) forms an outer ring around level 3–3.5.
· The actual maturity lines (gray and blue) form an almost perfect inner circle around

level 1.

· No domain extends beyond 1.2, confirming that no single function exceeds the “Initial”

phase of maturity.

The TLP classification for this summary remains AMBER, reflecting that core elements exist
but require significant development to align with the ESSENTIAL-level cybersecurity
expectations of the CyberFundamentals Framework.</pre>
