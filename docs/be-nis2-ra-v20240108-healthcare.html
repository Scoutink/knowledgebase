			<pre>CHOOSING THE RIGHT CYBER FUNDAMENTALS ASSURANCE LEVEL FOR YOUR
ORGANIZATION – healthcare sector

This tool is developed by the Centre for Cybersecurity Belgium
to conduct an easy risk assessment resulting in a well-informed
selection of the appropriate Cyber Fundamentals Assurance
Level in the context of NIS2.

Healthcare sector

Healthcare providers; EU reference laboratories; R&amp;D of medicinal products;
manufacturing basic pharma products and preparations; manufacturing of
medical devices critical during public health emergency

Special case: entities holding a distribution authorization for medicinal
products: only if identified as CER

			<pre>Probability

· Low (0):

This type of threat actor is not known to have executed this kind of attack in this sector.
There are no indications that this might be the case in the near future.
Risk evaluation: Risk is acceptable as is — the risk can be accepted without further
action.

· Medium (0.5):

This type of threat actor is known to have executed this kind of attack globally.
It is reasonable to accept that this might be the case in this sector in the near future.
Risk evaluation: Risk is tolerable under control — a follow-up in terms of risk
management shall be conducted and actions shall be set up in the context of medium- and
long-term continuous improvement.

· High (1):

This type of threat actor is known to have executed this kind of attack in this sector.
It is reasonable to assume that this will reoccur in this sector in the near future.
Risk evaluation: Risk is unacceptable — measures for reducing the risk shall absolutely
be taken in the short term. Otherwise, all or a portion of the activity should be
discontinued.

Impact

· Low = 0
· Medium = 5
· High = 10

Type of Attack and Required Protection Value

· Global: 1
· Targeted: 2

In global or un-targeted attacks (value 1), attackers indiscriminately target as many devices,
services, or users as possible.
They do not care about who the victim is, as there will be a number of machines or services with
vulnerabilities.

Targeted attacks refer to a type of threat in which threat actors actively pursue and compromise a
target entity’s infrastructure.
Typically, these threat actors have a certain level of expertise and have sufficient resources to</pre>

			<pre>conduct their schemes over a long-term period.
For this reason, a greater degree of protection is required (value 2).</pre>
