# NIS2 Routing Guide (KB‑only)

Use this guide to quickly locate relevant sources within the knowledgebase:

- Legal base and articles: `17_1_BelgischStaatsblad_MoniteurBelge.pdf` (Belgian publication). For article/annex mentions, also consult `NIS2_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`.
- CyberFundamentals framework: `CyFUN_*` PDFs and related maturity descriptions; for mappings and self‑assessments use the CyFun mapping and self‑assessment XLSX files.
- Policies and procedures templates: access control, network, incident response, backup/recovery, passwords, vulnerability/patch management.
- Risk and impact: `BE-NIS2-RA-*.xlsx`, `IMPACT LEVELS_*.pdf`.

Typical routing by topic (then consult the specific file names above):
- Incident reporting & timelines → Legal base + Incident Response Plan template.
- Risk management & governance → Legal base + CyFun governance/keys + risk XLSX.
- Asset management → Policy templates + CyFun maturity guidance.
- Vulnerability & patch → Policy template + CyFun + mapping.
- Access control & authentication → Access control/password policies + CyFun.
- Network security & monitoring → Network policy + CyFun detection/monitoring.
- Backup & recovery / business continuity → Backup policy + CyFun continuity.
- Supply chain / third parties → CyFun key‑govern + mapping + self‑assessment.
- Training & exercises → Incident response/testing sections in templates + CyFun.

Always cross‑check article/annex references via `NIS2_REFERENCE_INDEX.md`. If none are present in the KB for the topic, state “None found in KB.”
