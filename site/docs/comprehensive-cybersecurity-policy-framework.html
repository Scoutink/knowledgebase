4. BACKUP AND RECOVERY POLICY

Purpose

Protect critical information and information systems against data loss and damage through
backup and recovery procedures.

Note: Backup not necessary when:

· Data loss is acceptable
· Other control measures overcome disaster situations
· Example: PLC system with static configuration easily redeployed/replaced

Responsibilities

· Owner: Responsible for efficient backup and recovery process meeting business needs
· Operational tasks: Can be delegated to system administrators or vendors

Backup and Recovery Procedure

Required for all critical systems, defining:

· What information to backup (systems AND data)
· How to make backup
· Backup monitoring
· When and how often to backup
· How long to keep backup
· How and where to store backup
· How backup data is transferred

RPO and RTO
RPO (Recovery Point Objective):

· Maximum period during which data can be lost due to major incident
· Example: Static copy made nightly at 2 AM = 24-hour maximum data loss

RTO (Recovery Time Objective):

· Length of time required to recover data</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-11">
			<h3>Page 11</h3>
			<pre>Recommended: Use GFS (Grandfather-Father-Son) scheme (see Annex 1)

Access to Backup and Encryption
Requirements:

· Backups have at least same protection level as original data
· Encrypt confidential backup data when:

o Physically/logically stored in accessible locations
o Network traffic for backup
o Backup media stored/transferred by unauthorized persons
o Backup files on media in accessible locations

· Backup encryption key for off-site media not stored only on-site

Offsite Backup

· Store backup data in different physical location from data itself
· Maintain overview of off-site media
· Recommended: Use 3-2-1 backup strategy (see Annex 2)

Backup Monitoring

· Monitor backup process for proper operation
· Address errors
· Demonstrate proper operation via logs, reports, or automated system

Recovery Test

· Perform recovery tests at least once a year for all backup methods used for critical

systems

· Operational restore (unplanned) outside scheduled test counts as recovery test

ANNEX 1: GFS Backup Schedule

What is Grandfather-Father-Son Backup?
Popular data backup method combining full and partial copies to different media to:

· Reduce backup time
·

Improve storage security

GFS Backup Rotation Principle
Three Planned Steps:

1. Grandfather (G): Full backup to particular site, one off-site or multiple sites
2.
3.

Father (F): Another full backup, more regularly, to faster storage
Son (S): Incremental backup (or differential) to same storage as &#34;father&#34;</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-12">
			<h3>Page 12</h3>
			<pre>Example GFS Scheme
Daily Backups (Son):

· Four backup media labeled for weekdays (Monday-Thursday)
· Each tape used on labeled day
·
·

1-week version history: Overwrite weekly
3-week version history (recommended): More tapes needed

Weekly Backups (Father):

· Up to five weekly backup media (&#34;Week1&#34;, &#34;Week2&#34;, etc.)
· Full backups recorded weekly on day &#34;Son&#34; media not used (Friday)
· Reused monthly
· Five weekly tapes for 1-month file history

Monthly Backups (Grandfather):

· Three media labeled (&#34;Month1&#34;, &#34;Month2&#34;, etc.)
· Full backups on last business day of each month
· Overwritten quarterly or annually (recommended)

Schematic Representation:

Mon Tue Wed Thu Week 1
Mon Tue Wed Thu Week 2
Mon Tue Wed Thu Week 3
Mon Tue Wed Thu Month1

Data Backup Techniques
1. Full Backup

· Complete copying of entire data set
· Takes up significant space, time, and resources
· Makes many unnecessary data copies

2. Incremental Data Backup

· After initial full backup, stores only differences from previous incremental backup
· Processes only files that appeared or changed since previous backup

3. Differential Data Backup

· Similar to incremental
· After initial full backup, stores only differences from last full backup

4. Mixed Data Backup</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-13">
			<h3>Page 13</h3>
			<pre>· Combination of full and partial backups (incremental or differential)
· Similar to versioned backup technique
· Full backup followed by fixed amount of partial backups

ANNEX 2: 3-2-1 Backup Strategy

Definition
Proven data protection and recovery method ensuring:

· Data adequately protected
· Up-to-date backup copies available when needed

Basic Concept:

·
·
·

3 backups of data to be protected
2 different types of storage media
1 backup sent to another location

Classic 3-2-1 Scenario

· Backup software backs up mission-critical data
· Backup stored on another on-premises storage device
· Two more backups stored on two other devices
· Traditionally: At least one device was tape library (easy portable backup)
· Modern: Tape often replaced by hard disk storage system

Current Relevance:

· Still embraced by backup vendors as &#34;best practice&#34;
· Valid regardless of how/where company stores data
· Adapted for new requirements and big data

3-2-1 Backup Rules
Rule 1: Three Data Copies

· Three copies of backups of all critical data
· Regular backups (daily or more often)
·

Includes original data and at least two backups

Rule 2: Two Types of Storage

· Two different storage types for backup data
· Minimizes risk of failure
· Types: Internal hard drive, external hard drive, removable storage, tape library, secondary

storage array, cloud backup</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-14">
			<h3>Page 14</h3>
			<pre>Rule 3: One Off-site Location

· At least one backup copy sent to off-site storage facility
· Ensures natural/geographical disasters cannot affect all copies
· Physically delivered (tape) or replicated via telecommunications

Importance of 3-2-1 Rule
Benefits:

· Eliminates single point of failure for data
· Protects against:

o Data corruption
o Technology failures
o Natural disasters
o Theft

· Recognized as &#34;best practice&#34; for information security professionals

Data Recovery Process
Step 1: Original (active) data corrupted/damaged/lost

· Restore from backup copy stored internally on another media/secondary storage

Step 2: Second data copy unavailable/unusable

· Retrieve off-site copy to internal servers

Step 3: Restart 3-2-1 process ASAP

· Once suitable data copy attached and operation restored
· Ensure data remains adequately protected

Modern Backup Uses
Development and Testing:

· DevOps requires easy access to data close to live application data
· Backup data provides fresh, regularly generated data

Analytical Applications:

· Need access to large amounts of current data
· Fresh backup data provides reliable, accurate results

Important Considerations:

If backup copy used for development/analytics: may be modified or unavailable

·
· Renders one of three required copies unusable if recovery needed</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-15">
			<h3>Page 15</h3>
			<pre>· Manage controls to ensure applications get best possible data

Data Integrity:

· Key concern in data protection
· Not enough to just back up and lock away copies
· Must ensure backups are: complete, undamaged, recoverable
· Recovery testing helps verify integrity
· Advanced backup app features detect ransomware and threats

3-2-1 Backup Management Principles
Basic Principles:

· All data copies identical and up-to-date
· Media storing copies are readable
· All specimens and equipment tested and confirmed working
· Remote copies stored securely
· Recovery regularly tested (single/multiple files or full backup)
Internal data copies on different storage systems and networks
·
Internal copies cannot be accessed from outside company
·

Backup Software Benefits:

· Automatically controls disposition of backups
· Catalogues all backup activity
· Features to check for threats (malware, ransomware, viruses)

3-2-1 Summary
Best practice combining:

· GFS scheme: Focuses on RPO-RTO of data
·

3-2-1 strategy: Focuses on storing backups made

Example Implementation:

· Data on NAS with RAID 10 disks
· Nightly backup via backup server to separate NAS (separate network)
· Full backup takes &gt;12 hours
· GFS schedule chosen for changing data
· Weekly and monthly backups copied to secure cloud environment
· Combines 3-2-1 strategy with GFS backup schedule</pre>

5. Containment, Evidence Collection and Remediation
A. Containment

Importance:

· Prevents incident from overwhelming resources
· Reduces damage
· Provides time to develop tailored recovery strategy

Containment Strategies Vary by Incident Type

Criteria for Strategy Selection:

· Possible damage to and theft of resources
· Preservation of evidence
· Availability of services
· Time and resources needed
· Effectiveness of strategy (partial vs. full containment)
· Duration of solution (emergency, temporary, permanent)

Considerations:

· Some attacks cause additional damage when contained
· Example: Malicious process may overwrite/encrypt data when disconnected
· Sandboxing possible but requires legal department discussion
· Delayed containment dangerous (attacker can escalate)

B. Documentation

Information to Document:

· Date and time of incident
· Current status
· Contact details of relevant individuals
· Scope and impact
· Severity
· Type and classification
· Need for external help (with contact information)
· Actions taken to contain and resolve</pre>

token)

· Other parts sent via other distribution methods
· User expects message and likely to use soon
·

Information expires after first use OR after 1 month if not used

8. VULNERABILITY AND PATCH MANAGEMENT
POLICY

Purpose

Eliminate known vulnerabilities through good patch management system and vulnerability
monitoring.

Context:

· Vulnerability = flaw/weakness in design or implementation that can compromise security</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-30">
			<h3>Page 30</h3>
			<pre>· More than 90% of malware infections or cybercrimes start with exploiting known leak
· Systems allowing incoming internet connections face numerous attacks daily

Managing Vulnerabilities

Risk Assessment

[Organization] conducts annual risk assessment

·
· Determines risk based on: threats, vulnerabilities, impacts on business processes and

assets

· Vulnerabilities = weakness in hardware, software, or procedures

Scanning for Internal Vulnerabilities
Frequency by System Criticality:

System Level

Critical and Confidential Systems

Highly Critical and Highly Confidential
Systems
Tools:

Scan Frequency

At least annually, quarterly, or
continuously

At least monthly

· Vulnerability scanning tools or penetration tests
· Contain database of known vulnerabilities
· Can scan single system or entire network
· Note: Only scan vulnerabilities they have access to (firewalls may block some)

Risk Classification:

· Tools classify weaknesses into different risk levels
· Highest risk: Vulnerability exploitable from internet
· Lower risk: Vulnerability usable by infected system to spread malware

Scanning for External Vulnerabilities
Frequency: Annually, quarterly, or continuous scanning

Purpose:

· External vulnerability scan (pen test) performed
· Results form basis for vulnerability improvement plan (annual, 6-monthly, or monthly)
· Serves as independent measure of system security

IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)
Purpose:

· While vulnerability scanners detect potential risks
·

IDS/IPS provide real-time network monitoring for malicious actions</pre>
		</li>
		
		<li id="page-31">
			<h3>Page 31</h3>
			<pre>·
·

IDS: Sends alert when suspicious behavior noticed
IPS: Takes action (e.g., blocking traffic in firewall)

Consideration: For critical/confidential systems if risk outweighs cost

CVDP - Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
Requirement: For organizations pursuing CyFun assurance level Important or Essential

Definition: Set of predetermined rules allowing participants (&#34;ethical hackers&#34;) with good
intentions to:

· Detect possible vulnerabilities in systems
· Provide relevant information about them

Must Include:

· Legal framework for cooperation
· Guarantee confidentiality of exchanged information
· Frame disclosure of vulnerabilities (responsible and coordinated manner)
· Made public (usually on website)
